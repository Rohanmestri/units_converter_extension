# EXPERIMENT

We basically devised three situations wherein the subjects had to perfom various convertions from one unit to another.
In each experiment the conversion had to be done once without using our extension and then again using the extension.


Next, we did a thorough analysis of the time taken by each subject for every experiment. The time in each case was noted and the following graphs were obtained.


## EXPERIMENT 1

Your birthday is coming up and you want to throw a party. Your friends are very enthusiastic about your birthday and are visiting you from California. At the same time your friends are annoyingly picky about certain things and they donâ€™t miss any chance to trouble you. You have to throw them a party and you are searching for suitable areas in the neighborhood. Now, your friends have maintained the following restrictions:
They will directly travel from RDU to the party destination
They want the party place to be as close as possible to 30 kms
The place has to be reachable in around 1500 secs (annoyingly picky right!)

You have the following four areas shortlisted. Select one best suited area in each case.

## EXPERIMENT 2

You want to gift a refrigerator to your parents in India from the following page. The price of the refrigerator should not be more than 350 US dollars and the height should not be more than 5 ft as it may not fit well.

Comparison of Average time

## CONCLUSION

From each of above experiments we conclude that in each instance, the time to convert one unit to another was significantly less while using extention versus using any
other method. Also, each participant felt that the extention made the process significantly easy and they would prefer using it.
