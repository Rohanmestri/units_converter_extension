# EXPERIMENT

We basically devised three situations wherein the labrats had to perfom various convertions from one unit to another.
In each of the experiment, the converstion has to be done once with using our extention and then without using the extentsion 
but using suitable way one seems fit.

In every experiment then a thorough analysis on time is done. The time in each cases is noted and the following graphs are obtained
